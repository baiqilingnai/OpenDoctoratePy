## Changing contengency contract season
Change the value of key `selectedCrisis` in `config\config.json` to whatever you want. The avaiable seasons are in `data\crisis`.

## Customizing indivual operators level, potentials, skill ranks and others
Customize each operator indivually by adding new info in `customUnitInfo` key in `config\config.json`. You can find <operator_key_name> from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kengxxiao/ArknightsGameData/master/zh_CN/gamedata/excel/character_table.json). By default, all characters will have max level, max potentials, max mastery.

- `mainSkillLvl` - Skill Rank (Put mastery at 0 if this is lower than 7)
- `potentialRank` - 0-5
- `evolvePhase` - 0 - E0, 1 - E1, 2 - E2
- `skills` - Mastery level for each skill starting from S1.

### Format
```
"<operator_key_name>": {
    "favorPoint": 25570,
    "mainSkillLvl": 7,
    "potentialRank": 2,
    "level": 50, 
    "evolvePhase": 1,
    "skills": [1, 0]
}
```

## Customizing support unit

- `charId` - key of the character
- `skinId` - skinId of the character (Skin List can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kengxxiao/ArknightsGameData/master/zh_CN/gamedata/excel/skin_table.json))
- `skillIndex` - Skill Index of the support unit (Index starts from 0).

Note: Characters stats and skill masteries are based on the above parameters.
